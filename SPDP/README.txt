Overview:
This is a build of My Turn in python, done in boredom to bring it back to life because it was really fun and didn't deserve to die.
Probably rather buggy.

Update log:

6/19/2023
Summary: Repo started and code uploaded. Makes the starter lineup and is able to make the deck and hands. Turn and game logic not yet existent.
Changes from last update: None, no last update.
Tweaks from original game: Empower effect was a 1.25 multiplier to damage, but is currently set at 1.5. However, as turn and game logic doesn't exist yet, this is very ignorable since it doesn't see use.
