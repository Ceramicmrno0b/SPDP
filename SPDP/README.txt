Overview:
This is a build of My Turn in python, done in boredom to bring it back to life because it was really fun and didn't deserve to die.
Probably rather buggy.

Update log:

6/21/2023
Summary: Modded code to be functions for increased organization.
Changed from last update: Changed the amount of attack cards added to the deck from 3 to 2, I had misremembered the amount in the deck but found the correct amount and fixed it. Changed code to be in functions. Added break/bolster variable to heros.
Tweaks from original game: Break increases damage taken by 50% instead of normal 25%. However, this is still not implemented and has no effect yet.

6/19/2023
Summary: Repo started and code uploaded. Makes the starter lineup minus the items and equipment and is able to make the deck and hands. Turn and game logic not yet existent.
Changes from last update: None, no last update.
Tweaks from original game: Empower effect was a 1.25 multiplier to damage, but is currently set at 1.5. However, as turn and game logic doesn't exist yet, this is very ignorable since it doesn't see use.
